# Alien Invasion Game

This project is an implementation of the Alien Invasion game in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a ship that appears at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right. The player can shoot bullets at the aliens that are moving across the screen. The goal is to shoot all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Once you have Python 3 and Pygame installed, you can run the game by running the following command:

<!--
```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```
<!--  -->
```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

* Left Arrow Key: Move left
* Right Arrow Key: Move right
* Spacebar: Shoot bullet


## How to Play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship. Use the spacebar to shoot bullets at the aliens.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to shoot down all the aliens without getting hit by their attacks. The player can move the spaceship left or right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the space bar.

The game features multiple levels of increasing difficulty, with more aliens and faster movement speeds. The player has three lives, and the game ends if all lives are lost.
